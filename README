Practicing machine learning concepts -- proj2. 

Using linear regression with gradient descent/normal equation
with the "Computer Hardware" dataset from UCI to try to predict
performance of different CPUs.

Plots cost function as a function of the number of iterations.

Debugging the learning algorithm using "learning curves", to see
the cross validation error and test set error as a function of
training set size.


How to run:
Run the project using Matlab or GNU Octave.
